We analyze sparsely-sampled near-infrared (JHKs) light curves of a sample of 1781 Mira variable candidates in M33, originally discovered using I-band time-series observations. We extend our single-band semi-parametric Gaussian process modeling of Mira light curves to a multi-band version and obtain improved period determinations. We use our previous results on near-infrared properties of candidate Miras in the LMC to classify the majority of the M33 sample into Oxygen- or Carbon-rich subsets. We derive Period-Luminosity relations for O-rich Miras and determine a distance modulus for M33 of 24.80 +- 0.06 mag.
