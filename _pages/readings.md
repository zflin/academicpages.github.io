## A Probability Path (1999) <a name="app"></a>

* Author: Sidney I. Resnick
* Year of reading: 2014

<!--
Thanks to Dr. Huang’s recommendation, I had the opportunity to appreciate the book *A Probability Path* written by Sidney Resnick. Reading this book, just as the picture in its cover suggested, was an amazing tour like skateboarding along a "probability" path.

I did take an optional course of Measure Theory as an undergraduate, given by Dr. Guo in the department of statistics in Sun Yat-sen University, who later gave me an early admission to his Master’s program without exam. Thus many theorems and results outlined in A Probability Path were actually quite familiar to me. Nonetheless, this did not render my reading any less interesting, because this book conveyed knowledge in such a humorous and thought-provoking way that indeed made me rethink in different angles about what I already knew, more than just mechanic reviewing.

I felt the author’s enthusiasm right away at the initial glance the book name "A Probability Path." After a quick and thorough reading, I am deeply touched by the engaging probability theory system painstakingly and elaborately established by the author. Resnick’s humorous writing style made my reading much more fun. For example, when I reached at an answer of B=0 to exercise 8.8.6 (ii) by myself, I was surprised to see that Resnick said "B=17", but subsequent remarks in the brackets "(just kidding, B=0)" literally made me laugh for a while. Resnick’s wisdom and love for statistics have been displayed vividly through such naughty "mistakes." In fact, throughout the whole book, Resnick mentioned many times about the number 17; obviously he loves this number, maybe because about 200 years ago Gauss plotted the 17 regular polygon? Well, that’s certainly one important reason why I love 17, but not as important as that it is my wife’s birthday date. There were some typos in the book though, which I can easily understand without having to google up for a list of errata. Or maybe these typos are no more than Resnick’s intended jokes too.

There are totally 386 exercises in this book, and Resnick’s accessory booklet *A Probability Path Solution Manual* provides solution to one fourth of all questions. I have thought about every single exercise by myself, and selectively typed in my handwritten solutions to the three fourths of questions that were not addressed in his manual, as included in the contents of this PDF file. After completing my research and development assignments in OriginLab CO. Ltd, I tried my best to squeeze as much study time as possible and finished the reading and exercises of this book in three weeks. I do have several unsolved questions left; Nevertheless, I will get back to those tricky ones and update this PDF later. I have the confidence to work out all of them, given sufficient time.

I choose to start with A Probability Path among the several books that Prof. Huang has listed for me, because measure theory undoubtedly serves as the cornerstone of advanced statistics. I hope that, by thoroughly studying these books, I can expand my reservoir of statistics and mathematics knowledge, therefore become well equipped for the coming PhD research work. The journey of continued selfeducation after a busy workday really gives me a greater sense of fulfillment and achievement, and this experience will definitely be engraved in my memory.
