Welcome!

I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in statistics in Texas A\&M University. My expected graduation will be in 2019. 

My interests in statistics:

* Machine learning / data mining 

* Big / fat / thin / tall / short / high-dimensional (... any adjective word) data analysis

* Gaussian processes

* Statistical (Frequentist + Bayesian) computation
